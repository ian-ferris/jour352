        <h2 class="section-title">The Origins of the Gangster</h2>
        <p>
          Gangs have always been around in America, and you can likely trace their roots back centuries. However, it wasn’t until 
          Prohibition that the “gangster” was born as we think of it in the pop culture sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          During Prohibition, organized crime thrived—particularly the mafia. Since alcohol could no longer be legally distributed, 
          illegal organizations were able to corner the market and begin distributing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is when the most famous American gangsters thrived: Machine Gun Kelly, Bugsy Siegel, Pretty Boy Floyd, and, of course, 
          Al Capone.

              “Al Capone ruled an empire of crime in the Windy City: gambling, prostitution, bootlegging, bribery, narcotics 
              trafficking, robbery, ‘protection’ rackets, and murder. And it seemed that law enforcement couldn’t touch him.”

        <h2 class="section-title">Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>
          One of the keys to the mafia's success is its hierarchy. They have a clear power structure and chain of command that ensures 
          only select members interact with top leaders. This minimizes risk for those at the top and makes communication difficult 
          to trace.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the top is the boss, the undisputed leader of the organization. Think Al Capone, Tony Soprano, or The Godfather.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second in command is called the underboss, who is usually being groomed to take over if something happens to the boss.
        </p>
        <p>
          The consigliere, the third in command, serves as a trusted advisor and someone who knows the business well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next are the made men—reliable captains who control different factions of the organization. The made men oversee soldiers and 
          associates, who carry out the majority of the organization’s business and crime.

        <h2 class="section-title">La Cosa Nostra and the RICO Act</h2>
        <p>
          In the decades following Prohibition, the federal government realized it had a real problem on its hands. In 1970, Congress 
          passed the Organized Crime Control Act, giving federal authorities more tools to prosecute elusive mafia members. The government 
          began a major push to eradicate La Cosa Nostra’s influence.
        </p>
        <p>
          They persevered, however, “achieving their pinnacle of power in the 1970s and 1980s,” according to James B. Jacobs in 
          <em>The Rise and Fall of Organized Crime in the United States</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The irony of reaching your peak, however, is that it’s all downhill from there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The RICO Act and advancements in technology gave the FBI the tools to finally catch elusive mobsters in the act and put 
          them away for good.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most famous RICO case was that of John Gotti, the head of the Gambino family—one of the five major families in New York 
          City. Gotti had repeatedly avoided the law in the past but was finally convicted on 13 counts in 1992 and put away for good.

        <h2 class="section-title">Organized Crime Now</h2>
        <p>
          According to the FBI, “The Mafia—also known as La Cosa Nostra—may no longer possess the robust national presence and influence 
          it once had, [but] it remains a significant threat in the New York metropolitan area, New England, Philadelphia, Chicago, 
          and Detroit.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The RICO Act remains a useful tool for prosecutors, but organized crime today more often takes forms other than the mafia.
        </p>
        <p>
            In more recent years the most notorious RICO cases have involved rappers. Young Thug, Bobby Shmurda, Fetty Wap, and 6ix9ine have all been hit with RICO charges in the last 10 years. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps the Mafia has faded but the American gangster will continue to take on new forms and enthrall and frighten pop culture with their high octane lifestyles.
