    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <h3>How to Ripen Bananas Quicker</h3>
    <p>Place bananas in a paper bag and leave them in a warm area for quicker ripening. When the peels get spotted and slightly blacken, and the bananas become soft, they will be ready.</p>
   
    <h3>How to Store Banana Bread</h3>
    <p>Once the bread cools, store it in an airtight container for one day on the counter and then in the fridge for up to a week.</p>
